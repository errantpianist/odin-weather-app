## Features

- A weather app implemented using pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Can check current weather for any location using weatherapi

<br>

## Outcome

- Used async/await to make API calls and load data asynchronously
- Used CSS3 **flex** to manage layout
- Used **webpack**, **NPM** and **Git** to manage project and dependencies

<br>

## What I learned

- Use of **Javascript** async/await syntax to handle asynchronicity
- Use of a public API - weatherapi

<br>

## Reflections

This was a quick and simple project. There was plenty more data provided by the API that I could have worked with given more time, and presentation could be more exciting.
